    description: "Comprehensive fact table tracking THORchain Yield (TCY) reward claim events and transactions. This table captures detailed information about users claiming their earned TCY rewards including transaction IDs, claimed TCY amounts, asset types, RUNE addresses, L1 addresses for cross-chain operations, memo fields, and precise timing information. Essential for yield analysis and reward distribution tracking, understanding user claiming behavior patterns, calculating total rewards distributed, and analyzing cross-chain reward mechanics. Each record represents a unique TCY reward claim transaction with complete user and transaction metadata for thorough yield farming analysis, reward distribution monitoring, and protocol performance evaluation."
